This repository contains my writeups for various cybersecurity challenges completed as part of ACM practice tasks. The challenges span multiple categories including OSINT and MISC, focusing on investigation, file analysis, metadata inspection, steganography, password cracking, and hidden data extraction.
These challenges emphasize practical, hands-on problem solving commonly encountered in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and real-world security analysis scenarios.

 Objectives of This Repository

1. Record structured approaches to solving security challenges

2. Demonstrate practical use of cybersecurity tools

3. Build a reference for recurring techniques and patt3erns

4. Strengthen analytical and investigative thinking

5. Serve as a learning resource for future practice


Problem-Solving Philosophy

Rather than blindly applying tools, the focus throughout these challenges was:

    1. Understanding the nature of the artifact (file, image, archive, etc.)

    2. Identifying anomalies, hidden structures, or clues

    3. Applying targeted techniques based on observations

    4. Iteratively refining hypotheses

    5. Validating findings through technical analysis
    

Common Techniques Explored

  Across the challenges, several recurring techniques were applied:

    1. Metadata inspection for hidden hints

    2. Steganography analysis for concealed data

    3. Archive exploration for nested payloads

    4. Strings analysis for embedded secrets

    5. Encoding / decoding workflows (Base64, etc.)

    6. Password recovery attacks using wordlists

    7. Binary inspection & extraction
